
Lonely shadows following me
Lonely ghosts come a-calling
Lonely voices talking to me
Now I'm gone, now I'm gone, now I'm gone

And my mother told me, "Son, let it be."
Sold my soul to the calling
Sold my soul to a sweet melody
Now I'm gone, now I'm gone, now I'm gone

Oh, gimme that fire
Oh, gimme that fire
Oh, gimme that fire
Burn, burn, burn

Oh, a thousand faces staring at me
Thousand times I've fallen
Thousand voices dead at my feet
Now I'm gone, now I'm gone, now I'm gone

And my mother told me, "Son, let it be."
Sold my soul to the calling
Sold my soul to a sweet melody
Now I'm gone, now I'm gone, now I'm gone

Oh, gimme that fire
Oh, gimme that fire
Oh, gimme that fire
Burn, burn, burn

Ghosts and devils come a-calling
Calling my name, oh, lost in the fire
Sweet Virginia blood is calling
Calling my name, oh, lost in the fire

Oh, gimme that fire
Oh, gimme that fire
Burn, burn, burn

Oh, gimme that fire
Oh, gimme that fire
Oh, gimme that fire
Burn, burn, burn
